    <h1>Vanilla JavaScript App</h1>
    <p> On 1 October 2023 Australia’s profit-to-member superannuation funds established a new collective voice – the Super Members Council of Australia – following a decision by the super funds who were members of AIST and ISA to create a new single, collective voice for the profit-to-member funds and their members. 
 
Our purpose is to advocate for everyday Australians earning super during their life and benefiting from it in retirement, and ensure superannuation policy is stable, effective and equitable. 
 
Our new website is currently under construction.  </p>
